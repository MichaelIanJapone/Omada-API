This project is a data integration tool designed to collect network performance metrics from the Omada Controller API and store them in InfluxDB 2.x for monitoring and analysis. It connects to multiple Omada sites, retrieves key statistics such as traffic activity, retry/drop rates, and ISP load, and formats the data for time-series storage. The stored data can then be visualized in Grafana dashboards for real-time insights into network performance. This setup is ideal for network administrators looking to automate performance monitoring and maintain a centralized, visual overview of their Omada-managed infrastructure.
